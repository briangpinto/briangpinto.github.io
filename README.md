### Examining Influential Factors on Poverty Status (Group Project)
[Project Link](https://github.com/briangpinto/DSI-320-Group-Project)

Utilized clustering (KMeans, DBScan, KModes, KPrototypes) and inferential classification techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier) to determine how specific factors influence Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) poverty likelihood.

### Music Genre Classification
[Project Link](https://github.com/briangpinto/Music-Genre-Classification)

Utilized Librosa (audio analysis) package and created a multitude of models to accurately classify music by genre given one thousand, 30 sec samples of music audio divided into 10 genres.
